# CS---350-Emerging-Systems-Architecture-and-Technology

•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this project, we were to program a system that used a temperature sensor to read room temperature. For the prototype we were to use the presses of a button in order to change the temperature on the board. The TI boards LED light indicates that the output to the thermostat. The LED on will mean the heat is on.

•	What did you do particularly well?
For this project, I feel that I problem solved particularly well. When I was stuck on some lines of code and was unable to figure out why, I was able to fix the mistakes after researching for some time. Once I was able to find a relatable post, I was able to figure out what I was doing incorrectly and reduce the problems within my program

•	Where could you improve?
In terms of my project, I could improve on learning how my program failed, and why it was not able to create the target file. If I was able to figure this out, I would have a near perfect program that meets the requirements that the client was asking for. Hopefully in the future, I will be able to understand why my program was having errors so I can correct what is going on in the long run, and have a strong deliverable to the client. 

•	What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
A tool that I am using to support my network is StackOverflow, GeeksForGeeks, and git hub in order to understand which way I should go about configuring my application to the requirement that were given. This will help me understand the presented problems and help with solutions that I can incorporate within my program.

•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
A skill that I have learned from this project is to not give up when you are facing challenges. This is extremely important when developing embedded system programs. I also learned that StackOverflow, and Texas Instruments website is very helpful when coming across an issue. These two skills will be used in future projects.

•	How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable I used in line comments to express what my line of thinking was when programming the assignment. I also used block of codes that related to one another for the system to look neat when looking at the code.
